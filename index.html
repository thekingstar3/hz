What's great is that it's not just about books; we get to do real tech stuff. Plus, everyone is friendly here, and I like that. It's like a big tech family.

          <p class="groove">In the HBO-ICT program, I want to learn all about technology and computers. I'm excited to become skilled in making software, keeping data safe, and analyzing information. I also hope to get better at solving tech problems, working in teams, and keeping up with new tech trends. Learning about the right and wrong ways to use technology is important to me too.</p>

          <h2>My motivation</h2>
        <p class="groove">I'm really excited about the HBO-ICT program because I love technology. I've always been fascinated by how it shapes our world and makes amazing things possible. My motivation comes from wanting to be a part of this tech-driven world, learn how things work, and use that knowledge to create new and cool stuff. The program's hands-on approach and focus on staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends match perfectly with what I want to learn. I can't wait to start this journey, not just for a career but because I'm genuinely passionate about technology.</p>
