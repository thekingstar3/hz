            <article>
              <p style="font-size: 21px;">My Personal SWOT analysis revealed my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It's a valuable tool to help me understand myself better and plan my career path. I'm determined to leverage my strengths and work on my weaknesses.</p>
              <h2><b><u>STRENGTHS</u></b></h2>
              <p style="font-size: 21px;">I have several positive traits that help me in my studies. I'm adaptable, which means I can adjust to new situations easily. I'm also good at solving problems and determined to succeed, stay curious to learn new things, and manage my time effectively.</p>
              <h2><b><u>WEAKNESSES</u></b></h2>
              <p style="font-size: 21px;">Sometimes, I can be a bit of a perfectionist, which means I might focus too much on small details and not get things done on time. I can also get impatient when things don't happen quickly. Being somewhat introverted might make it harder for me to talk and work with others.</p>
              <h2><b><u>OPPORTUNITIES</u></b></h2>
              <p style="font-size: 21px;">I'll use my adaptability and problem-solving skills to stay updated and tackle challenges. My determination will help me overcome obstacles. I'll fuel my curiosity through learning and manage time effectively. To address perfectionism, I'll set realistic goals, and for impatience, I'll break tasks into smaller steps. I'll improve introversion by engaging more with others.</p>
              <h2><b><u>THREATS</u></b></h2>
              <p style="font-size: 21px;">One challenge is the technical complexity of the field, as it involves understanding complex concepts and programming languages. Additionally, time management can be tricky, and procrastination might lead to last-minute stress. Effective communication is crucial, and I'm working on improving my skills in that area.</p>
